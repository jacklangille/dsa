How it works:
	- Repeatedly compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
	- The largest value “bubbles” to the top (last position) after each full pass.
    - Repeat until the entire list is sorted.
Complexity:
    - Time: O(n^2) worst/average case 
    - Space: O(1) (in place)
NEVER USE
