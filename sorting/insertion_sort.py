"""
Explanation:
    - Start with an empty (sorted) section and insert elements one by one in the correct position
    - Shift larger elements to the right to make room for the new insertion

Complexity: 
    - Time: O(n^2)
    - Space: O(1)

When to use: When dealing with small lists or nearly sorted data (like online sorting when data comes in real-time).
